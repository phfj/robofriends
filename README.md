# robofriends

This is my first react app.

It containts a list of robbots where each are represented as a Card.
Each Card contains the following:
  - robot image
  - name
  - user name
  - email address

There is also a search functionality where a robot can be searched with it's name, username or email address.

The search has a filtering effect on the CardList, and the serach result will only display the Card(s) that match the search entered by a user.
